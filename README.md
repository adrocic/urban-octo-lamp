## Make it Your Own!

### 1. Make sure you have what you need

To build this website, you will need to have the latest stable versions of Node and Yarn downloaded and installed on your machine. If you don't already have them, you can get Node [here,](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and Yarn [here.](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### 2. Fork and download this repo (and star if you like!)

Next, find the `Fork` button in the top right of this page. This will allow you to make your own copy, for more info on forking repo's see [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) After this, download to your development machine using the green `Code` button at the top of the repo page.

### 3. Install dependencies and run

Once you have your own copy of this repo forked and downloaded, open the folder in your favorite terminal and run `yarn install` to install dependencies. Following this, run `yarn dev` to run the project. In your terminal you should be given the url of the running instance (usually http://localhost:3000 unless you have something else running).
